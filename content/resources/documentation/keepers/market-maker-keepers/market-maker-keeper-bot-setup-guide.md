## 1. Introduction

This guide is dedicated to showing you how to create your very own Market Maker Keeper Bot as well as educate the community about Market Maker Keeper bots and help both users and developers understand the value of this incredible software. We are proud to say that all of the code needed to get a Market Maker Keeper bot up and running is open-sourced.

### List of current exchanges that Market Maker Keeper Bots can be built for

- OasisDEX `oasis-market-maker-keeper`
- EtherDelta `etherdelta-market-maker-keeper`
- RadarRelay and ERCdEX `0x-market-maker-keeper`
- Paradex `paradex-market-maker-keeper`
- DDEX `ddex-market-maker-keeper`
- Ethfinex `ethfinex-market-maker-keeper`
- GoPax `gopax-market-maker-keeper`
- OKEX `okex-market-maker-keeper`
- TheOcean `theocean-market-maker-keeper`

## 2. Prerequisite

- Git
- [Python v3.6.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/)
- [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
  - This project requires _virtualenv_ to be installed if you want to use Maker's python tools. This helps with making sure that you are running the right version of python and checks that all of the pip packages that are installed in the [install.sh](http://install.sh/) are in the right place and have the right versions.
- [X-code](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) for macs

## 3. Getting Started (Installation)

**1. Clone the `market-maker-keeper` repository and switch into its directory:**

```bash
 git clone git@github.com:makerdao/market-maker-keeper.git
 cd market-maker-keeper
```

**2. Initializing the git submodules that will bring in both the pymaker and the pyexchange library:**

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**3. Set up the virtual env and activate it:**

```bash
 python3 -m venv _virtualenv
 source _virtualenv/bin/activate
```

**4. Check to make sure you have the correct version Python 3.6.6 of Python by running:**

```bash
 python3 -V
```

**5. Install Requirements:**

```bash
pip3 install $(cat requirements.txt $(find lib -name requirements.txt | sort) | sort | uniq | sed 's/ *== */==/g')
```

- **Note:** This command is used in place of `pip install -r requirements.txt` for iterating through all the dependencies in the lib directory to grab all of the requirements needed.

#### Potential errors that could arise:

- Needing to upgrade to **pip** version 19.2.2.
  - Run: `pip install --upgrade pip` to fix.
- Installing **jsonnet** if running macOS Mojave

  **To fix, run the following:**

  - `xcode-select --install`
  - `open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg`
  - `pip3 install jsonnet==0.9.5`
  - **Re-run:** `pip3 install $(cat requirements.txt $(find lib -name requirements.txt | sort) | sort | uniq | sed 's/ *== */==/g')`

#### Other **Potential Installation Issues:**

Read the following document for other known Ubuntu and macOS issues [pymaker](https://github.com/makerdao/pymaker#known-ubuntu-issues).

## 4. Testing

There is quite a lot of value in running all the unit tests to make sure `market-maker keeper` has been installed properly. After the repository has been cloned and the installation has been completed, you can run unit tests by executing the following commands.

**Firstly, the following command will install the libraries required to run unit tests:**

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt

```

**To run the unit tests py.test, etc.., use the following script:**

```bash
./test.sh

```

**Example output:**

## 5. Understanding Bands Configuration

The Bands configuration file is directly related to how your Market Maker Keeper will work. As mentioned in the introduction, these Keepers continuously monitor and adjust their positions in the order book, maintaining open buy and sell orders in multiple bands at the same time. For each `buy` and `sell` band, the Keepers aim to have open orders for at least the `minAmount`. In both cases, they will ensure the price of open orders stay within the `<minMargin, maxMargin>` range from the current price. When running, Keepers place orders for the average amounts `avgAmount` in each band by using use `avgMargin` to calculate the order price.

As long as the price of orders stays within the set bands i.e. it is in between the `<minMargin,maxMargin>` range from the current price, the Keepers keep them open/running. If some orders leave the band, they either enter another adjacent band or fall outside all bands. In the case of the latter, they would get immediately canceled. In case of the former, Keepers can keep these orders open as long as their amount is within the `<minAmount,maxAmount>` ranges for the band they just entered. If it is above the maximum, some of the open orders will get canceled and potentially a new one will be created to bring the total amount back within the range. If it is below the minimum, a new order gets created for the remaining amount so that the total amount of orders in this band is equal to `avgAmount`. The same process will happen if the total amount of open orders in a band falls below the `minAmount` as a result of other market participants taking these orders. In this case, a new order gets created for the remaining amount so the total amount of orders in this band is equal to `avgAmount`. There are some Keepers that will constantly use gas to cancel orders ex: OasisDEX, EtherDelta and 0x and create new ones OasisDEX as the price changes. Gas usage can be limited by setting the margin and amount ranges wide enough but also by making sure that the bands are always adjacent to each other and that their `<min,max>` amount ranges overlap.

### File format

The bands configuration file consists of two main sections:

1. _buyBands_
2. _sellBands_

**Note:** Each section is an array containing one object per each band.

The _`minMargin`_ and _`maxMargin`_ fields in each band object represent the margin spread range of that band. These ranges may not overlap for bands of the same type _`buy`_ or _`sell`_, and should be adjacent to each other for better Keeper performance where fewer orders will get canceled if the bands are adjacent to each other. The _`avgMargin`_ represents the margin spread of newly created orders within a band.

#### Glossary

1. _`minAmount` - the_ minimum amount for keeper engagement for a band.
2. _`avgAmount`_ - the target amount for keeper engagement for a band.
3. _`maxAmount` - the_ maximum amount for keeper engagement for a band.
4. _`dustCutoff` - a_ field for the minimum amount of every single order created in each individual band expressed in buy tokens for buy bands and in sell tokens for sell bands.
   - Setting this to a non-zero value prevents Keepers from creating a lot of very tiny orders, which can cost a lot of gas. For example, in the case of OasisDEX, it can result in an order that is too small getting rejected by other exchanges.

### Setting up your own Bands Configuration File:

#### 1. Creating your bands.json file

To start, take the sample configuration file below and copy-paste it to a `.json` file within the root directory of your `market-maker-keeper` folder. For ease of use, we sugges to name it `bands.json`. This bands file will get configured as a command-line argument when we start up the Market Maker Keeper.

**A Sample bands.json file containing two Bands:**

This example shows bands for the ETH-DAI pair, where ETH represents the base currency and DAI as the quote currency:

```JSON
{
    "_buyToken": "DAI",
    "buyBands": [
        {
            "minMargin": 0.005,
            "avgMargin": 0.01,
            "maxMargin": 0.02,
            "minAmount": 20.0,
            "avgAmount": 30.0,
            "maxAmount": 40.0,
            "dustCutoff": 0.0
        },
        {
            "minMargin": 0.02,
            "avgMargin": 0.025,
            "maxMargin": 0.03,
            "minAmount": 40.0,
            "avgAmount": 60.0,
            "maxAmount": 80.0,
            "dustCutoff": 0.0
        }
    ],
    "buyLimits": [],

    "_sellToken": "ETH",
    "sellBands": [
        {
            "minMargin": 0.005,
            "avgMargin": 0.01,
            "maxMargin": 0.02,
            "minAmount": 2.5,
            "avgAmount": 5.0,
            "maxAmount": 7.5,
            "dustCutoff": 0.0
        },
        {
            "minMargin": 0.02,
            "avgMargin": 0.025,
            "maxMargin": 0.05,
            "minAmount": 4.0,
            "avgAmount": 6.0,
            "maxAmount": 8.0,
            "dustCutoff": 0.0
        }
    ],
    "sellLimits": []
}
```

This **bands.json** file should be adequate enough for you to paste and run it as is. Of course, you are free to configure it however you would like.

**Note:** Since this example will be focused on getting a Market Maker Keeper set up on Kovan, you need to make certain that you have enough Kovan ETH (K-Eth) to get your Keeper up and running. To receive Kovan ETH, join the following Gitter Channel: [https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet) and post your ETH address from your MetaMask account to the main chat. The Kovan faucet will then populate your wallet with the test funds (note that this could take a couple of minutes or a couple of hours as it is done manually by the channel’s administrator).

#### 2. Setting Amounts

You will need to set this up if you are going to be trading small amounts to start. This will need to be set up such that those amounts are sufficiently meaningful on the exchange you want to work with based on the rules of the exchanges that you want to work. For example, their specificly set dust limits.

As mentioned above, there is one parameter in the configuration file _`dustCutoff`_ that will be used to determine the `minAmount` of trade quantity. The `dustCutoff` will need to be set **higher than/or at** the `minAmount` trade quantity of the specific exchange. This is to make sure you don't create trades that are less than an exchanges' minimum trade requirements. Note that in your configuration file, you can also lower the required quantities to make it easier on yourself. Reducing the K-ETH amounts will be helpful in reducing wait times as you likely won't want to wait long periods to get enough K-ETH to run your Keeper.

#### **Bands Example**

Here, we will be going over some example interactions using the [bands.json file](https://www.notion.so/makerdao/Market-Maker-Keeper-Bot-Setup-Guide-c8add6654b154ddca27545f19f6f91af#f7b7143322f8421f93605a09d9cf579f) described above. These examples assume that it is denominated in DAI and the price of 10 DAI is 1 ETH.

**Using Band 1**

- If we look at the first buy band, the initial buy order will be 30 DAI _`avgAmount`_ with the price of -&gt; `price - (price * avgMargin)` -&gt; `0.1 - (0.1 * 0.01)` -&gt; `0.099 ETH per Dai`.
- If the `buy` order listed above 30 DAI @ 0.099 ETH gets partially filled 15 DAI are purchased, then we will have 15 DAI remaining in the order. However, this amount is below the band's _`minAmount`_ 20 DAI, therefore, another whole order of 15 DAI will be placed on the exchange at the same price of 0.099 ETH.
- In addition to the `buy` orders, when the Market Maker Keeper starts up, two `sell` orders will also be placed.

**Using Band 2**

- For ease of explanation, let's assume we are selling ETH priced at 100.00 DAI 5 ETH @ 101 DAI and 6 ETH @ 102.5 DAI.
- Now imagine a situation where the price of ETH suddenly drops to 97.50 DAI, pushing the bands down. In this scenario, the second band will start working and will become responsible for both of the `sell` orders, as they fit in between the second band's _`minMargin`_ and _`maxMargin`_.

**The Market Maker Keeper will now reset it's bands by performing the following:**

1. Creating an order in **Band 1** 5 ETH @ 98.475 DAI using _`avgMargin`_ and _`avgAmount`_.
2. Cancelling the second order 5 ETH @ 102.5 DAI which is now in **Band 2** becuase _`maxMargin`_ has been breached when `price + (price * maxMargin) = orderPrice` -&gt; `97.5 + (97.5 * 0.05)` -&gt; 102.375 &gt; 102.5.
3. Keep the first order 5 ETH @ 101 DAI, which is now in **Band 2** because it is within _`minMargin`_ and _`maxMargin`_ of **Band 2.**
4. Creating an order in **Band 2** 1 ETH @ 99.937 DAI using _`avgMargin`_ and _`avgAmount`._

**This results in a total of 3 orders:**

- **Band 1** -&gt; 5 ETH @ 98.475 DAI
- **Band 2** -&gt; 5 ETH @ 101 DAI
- **Band 2** -&gt; 1 ETH @ 99.837 DAI

## 6. **Order Rate Limitation**

Next, we will want to add the **Rate Limitation** to the configurations file. This will make sure that we don't constantly churn out old orders as well as help manage gas consumption. We do this because we want the `period` and the `amount` to be set to a low amount when we start out. This is done because we don't want new users' Market Maker Keeper bots to be frantically trading all of the time. The goal here is that we want to set up our initial states such that it is only placing an order every 5 min or so or whatever time amount you decide on.

There are two optional limit sections _`buyLimits`_ and _`sendLimits`_ that can be used for limiting the **maximum** rate of orders created by Market Maker Keepers. They both use the same format.

**Example of order rate limits:**

```JSON
"buyLimits": [
    {
        "period": "1h",
        "amount": 50.0
    },
    {
        "period": "1d",
        "amount": 200.0
    }
]
```

- The `period` defines the amount of time that the limit should be applied over.
- The `amount` is the maximum amount of orders that should be placed during the set `period` amount.

In the example above, the `period`s are set to 1-hour and 1-day and the `amount`s are set to 50.0 orders and 200.0 orders. This means that over the course of 1-hour, only 50.0 orders can be placed and over the course of 1-day, only 200.0 orders can be placed. The amounts will be expressed either in terms of the `buy` or the `sell` token, this will depend on the section. Note that the above snippet imposes a limit of _50.0_ `buy` token within each 60-minute window. Additionally, a maximum of _200.0_ `buy` tokens within each 24-hour window. Note that the supported time units are `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`, and `w`.

## 7. **Data Templating Language**

_The_ [_Jsonnet_](https://github.com/google/jsonnet) _data templating language that can be used for the configuration file._

In the case of the data templating language, think of this like a pre-processing language for parsing the file. The whole purpose of the jsonnet is to set up a configuration file such that you can have it increment based on a price. Therefore, in addition to the price feed, you can also base percentages away from the market price. As you can see below, there is a hardcoded amount/price and then the amounts below it which are dependent on the price.

```JSON
{
  "_price": 10,

  "_buyToken": "DAI",
  "buyBands": [
    {
      "minMargin": 0.020,
      "avgMargin": 0.050,
      "maxMargin": 0.075,
      "minAmount": 0.05 * $._price,
      "avgAmount": 0.25 * $._price,
      "maxAmount": 0.35 * $._price,
      "dustCutoff": 0.1
    }
  ],

  "_sellToken": "ETH",
  "sellBands": []
}
```

**Note:** If you are working with a token that's price does not fluctuate wildly, you do not need to incorporate relative qualities for your amount. This is typically for people who want Market Maker Keepers open for months at a time and don't want to worry about having to change any of their configurations.

Another thing to note about these files is that the Market Maker Keeper reloads the configuration files automatically when it detects a change in them. This makes it easier as you don't have to constantly restart your Keeper bot when you change your band configurations. In short, this works by periodically taking a hash of the configuration file and comparing that hash with the current version. When it sees a change in that hash of the file, it will reload the configuration file and cancel orders as necessary to maintain the newly updated bands.

## 8. Price Feed Configuration

The price feed is one of the most important determining factors of success in a Market Maker Keeper. If you have the bands set up the way you want, the price feed will help make sure your bands are set at meaningful levels relative to the inside market. If you have wide bands and your strategy is to add liquidity to handle market imbalances, then the price feed is not as important. However, as you tighten up the spreads, the price feed is a crucial component to ensure that you are going to profit in the market.

Below, we list some of the existing public feeds. You can also use web sockets if you have your own price feed that you want to use. In short, it works by each Market Maker Keeper taking in a `--price-feed` command-line argument which then determines the price used for market-making.

**As of today, these are the possible values of this argument that we list some of the existing public feeds:**

- `fixed:200` - uses a fixed price, `1.56` in this example. See below for a more in-depth example. When on mainnet, you typically won't use a fixed amount but it is an ideal example for this walkthrough as there aren't price feeds for Kovan.
- `eth_dai` - uses the price from the GDAX WebSocket ETH/USD price feed.
- `eth_dai-setzer` - uses the average of Kraken and Gemini ETH/USD prices.
- `eth_dai-tub` - uses the price feed from `Tub` only works for keepers being able to access an Ethereum node.
- `dai_eth` - inverse of the `eth_dai` price feed.
- `dai_eth-setzer` - inverse of the `eth_dai-setzer` price feed.
- `dai_eth-tub` - inverse of the `eth_dai-tub` price feed.
- `btc_dai` - uses the price from the GDAX WebSocket BTC/USD price feed.
- `dai_btc` - inverse of the `btc_dai` price feed.
- `ws://...` or `wss://...` - uses a price feed advertised over a WebSocket connection custom protocol.

Additionally, we have a Uniswap price feed that can be used by Market Maker Keepers: [https://github.com/makerdao/uniswap-price-feed ](https://github.com/makerdao/uniswap-price-feed).

**Note:** The `--price-feed` command line argument can also contain a comma-separated list of several different price feeds. In this case, if one of them becomes unavailable, the next one in the list will be used instead. All listed price feeds will be constantly running in the background, the second one and following ones ready to take over when the first one becomes unavailable. **In the example below in the Running Keepers section, you can see an example of how to use a fixed price amount.**

## 9. Running Market Maker Keepers

Each Market Maker Keeper is a command-line tool which takes in generic command-line arguments such as `--config`, `--price-feed`, `--price-feed-expiry`, `--debug`, etc. as well as some arguments which are specific to that particular Keeper such as Ethereum node parameters, addresses, exchange API keys, etc.. All accepted command-line arguments are listed in the example section below. They can also be discovered by trying to start a Market Maker Keeper with the `--help` argument.

#### Example (Oasis Market Maker Keeper)

In order to run `oasis-market-maker-keeper`, you will need to go through the following process:

1. Firstly, you would deploy an Ethereum node we recommend Parity.
2. Generate an account in it.
3. Permanently unlock that account.
4. Transfer some tokens to it.
5. Lastly, you can run the keeper as seen below.

The below file should be copy and pasted into a new file within the root directory of the repository `market-maker-keeper`. This should be placed within the same folder where you put the `bands.json` file.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

bin/oasis-market-maker-keeper \
    --rpc-host 127.0.0.1 \
    --rpc-port  \
    --rpc-timeout 10 \
    --eth-from [address of your generated Ethereum account] \
        --eth-key ${ACCOUNT_KEY} \
    --tub-address  0x448a5065aebb8e423f0896e6c5d525c040f59af3 \
    --oasis-address  0x14fbca95be7e99c15cc2996c6c9d841e54b79425 \
    --price-feed fixed:200 \
    --buy-token-address [address of the quote token, could be DAI] \
    --sell-token-address [address of the base token, could be WETH] \
    --config [path to the json bands configuration file, e.g bands.json] \
    --smart-gas-price \
    --min-eth-balance 0.001


```

- Make sure that you retrieve and paste the correct contract addresses when using the above snippet.
- `--eth-key ${ACCOUNT_KEY}` - includes both the `.json` file account.json of your account and a `.pass` file ex: account.pass that contains your password in plaintext.
- If you do not have an account, you can use [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/) on Kovan and export the account details by means of the Keystore file method. Make sure that you download the .json file to your local machine as this is what you will need to set up the account.

**List of required Kovan Addresses for the above :**

```bash
V2_OASIS_SERVER1_ADDRESS=
V2_OASIS_SERVER1_KEY="key_file=/home/ed/Projects/member-account.json,pass_file=/home/ed/Projects/member-account.pass"
TUB_ADDRESS=0xa71937147b55deb8a530c7229c442fd3f31b7db2 # tub-address
SAI_ADDRESS=0xc4375b7de8af5a38a93548eb8453a498222c4ff2 # buy-token-address
WETH_ADDRESS=0xd0a1e359811322d97991e03f863a0c30c2cf029c # sell-token-address
OASIS_ADDRESS_NEW=0x4a6bc4e803c62081ffebcc8d227b5a87a58f1f8f # oasis-address

```

**General Notes:**

- The `OASIS_SERVER1_KEY` is simply your Kovan account private key point this to your ETH accounts key file and password file. If you do not have this, please set up a file with your password in plain text.
- ETH From is the address location where the market-maker-keeper is going to get the tokens that it uses to participate and place orders.
  - **Example:** Since Oasis is a decentralized exchange dex, it is on-chain, so you need to provide all of the relevant addresses to the dex. Most DEX's are like this because when you are configuring with a dex you need to pass many addresses in, whereas, with a centralized exchange you are generally giving an API key, and username and password see below for an example of how the process differs for centralized exchanges differ versus decentralized exchanges.
- This Oasis example is currently for **Single Collateral DAI** SCD, where we configure the TUB_ADDRESS. However, as we move over to **Multi-Collateral DAI MCD** the **TUB_ADDRESS** will be changed to the **PIP_ADDRESS** for MCD.

#### **Once completed, you can now run your Market Maker Keeper! Follow the next steps to get it running:**

1. Open up your terminal
2. Run `chmod +x <the file name of your version of the above bin/oasis-market-maker-keeper snippet>`
3. Run `./<the file name of your version of the above bin/oasis-market-maker-keeper snippet>`
4. That's it, your Market Maker Keeper should now be running!

#### Market Maker Keepers on Centralized Exchanges versus Decentralized Exchanges

In the situation where you want to use a centralized exchange vs. a decentralized exchange, the process differs a little:

1. You would need to have an existing account or create an account on the exchange itself.
2. Get the set of API keys with trading permissions will usually need to be generated as well.
3. Deposit tokens in your account on the exchange as the keepers do not handle deposits and withdrawals themselves.
4. Run the Market Maker Keeper.
