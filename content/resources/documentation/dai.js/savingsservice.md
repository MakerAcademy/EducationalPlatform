# Dai Savings Rate

Use the `'mcd:savings'` service to work with the Dai Savings Rate system. In the code, this is called [SavingsService](https://github.com/makerdao/dai.js/blob/dev/packages/dai-plugin-mcd/src/SavingsService.js).

```javascript
const service = maker.service('mcd:savings');
```

```javascript
await service.join(DAI(1000));
```

### exitAll()

Withdraw all Dai owned by the current account from the DSR contract.

### balance()
