`live`: Cage flag

- "Live" contracts have `live` = 1, indicating the system is running normally. Thus, when `cage()` is invoked, it sets the flag to 0. This includes the `End` contract, which means that `cage()` can only be invoked once and the subsequent functions cannot be invoked until we are "dead" and in the End process

`ilk`: A collateral type

`Art`: Total debt per Ilk/outstanding stablecoin debt.

`fix`: Final cash price / the cash price for an ilk (amount per stablecoin).

`bag(usr: address)`: Dai packed for `cash` / nontransferable stablecoins ready to exchange for collateral.

`out`: Cash out / the amount of already exchanged stablecoin for a given address.

`skip`: Optionally cancel live auctions.

`wad`: Some quantity of tokens, usually as a fixed point integer with 10^18 decimal places.

`urn`: A specific Vault.

`tend`: To make a bid, increasing the bid size.

`bid`: The quantity being offered for the `lot`.

- `bite`: will not leave a Vault with debt and no collateral.
- `wards`: are allowed to call protected functions (Administration and `cage()`)
